## Chatbot Capabilities

You can ask the chatbot for real-time stock prices and portfolio information using natural language. For example:

**User:**

> What is the price of Netflix and NVIDIA stocks?

**Chatbot Output:**

```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "name": "Netflix, Inc.",
    "price": "$224.19",
    "volume": 1049834,
    "change": "-0.15%"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "name": "NVIDIA Corporation",
    "price": "$182.35",
    "volume": 127657525,
    "change": "+0.32%"
  }
]
```

> This is not a REST API endpoint. You interact with the chatbot using natural language, and it will respond with up-to-date stock information.

## Model Providers

This template ships with [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) `gemini-2.5` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

### Prerequisites

1. Docker installed on your machine
2. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
AUTH_SECRET=secret
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOGGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY
FMP_API_KEY=YOUR_FMP_API_KEY
POSTGRES_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONFIG
```

- The `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` can be created at https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key (It's free!)
- The `FMP_API_KEY` can be created at https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/ (It's also free!)

### Neon Database Setup

https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon

1. Visit [Vercel Neon Integration](https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores) and click "Create Database"
2. After creating, you'll be taken to the Neon dashboard
3. Choose the tab ".env.local" abd copy value and key from `POSTGRES_URL`
4. Replace the `POSTGRES_URL` in your `.env` file with this connection string

### Installation Steps

1. Start the required services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

2. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
3. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
